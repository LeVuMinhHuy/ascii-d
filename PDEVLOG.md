## Eraser Advanced

Idea:

- beside the default eraser, it will have 3 eraser advanced options: small(s), medium(m), large(l)
- users can select when they hover the eraser button in the ui and a popup will open with [s,m,l]
- users also can use the mapping: `es`, `em`, `el` for each eraser advanced options
